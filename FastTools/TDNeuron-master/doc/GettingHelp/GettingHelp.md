## Getting help

It can be overwhelming to navigate all the concepts required to understand machine learning and on top of it to understand how to use and make the most out of TDNeuron. Here some possible scenarios where you might need help with some pointers to follow.

### Questions

For general questions that you may have, please use the issue tracker on our Github repository, create a ticket and assign it the "question" label. Write a clear description of your inquiry and provide information that will allow us to answer it. We will try to answer your question promptly:

### Help on creating networks

It is rather difficult to explain in detail how to create a model and why it has to be done in one way or another, depending on your input data. At the moment, the best help you can get on this regard comes from checking the provided examples and to observe the many resources online that cover and explain the necessary layers to create a neural network for a given case. 

We have tried our best to get users familiar with the terminology and the foundations of deep learning in the tutorial "Introduction to machine learning" and to explain how a neural network gets created in TDNeuron in the guide "Getting started". We know however that it is not easy to understand fully why or how things work.

### Help on the software

We will be uploading progressively a number of tutorials to guide you through different processes using TDNeuron. This will cover a wide range of topics, starting from a more detailed account of linear and convolutional deep neural networks and ending with advanced topics, such as extending TDNeuron and creating your own nodes. This however takes time and effort. Our priority was to bring TDNeuron online, so these tutorials have at the moment lower priority and will unroll over time. Stay tuned!

### Help on the implementation

If you are looking already at how you can implement things and are curious on how does our platform work, there are a number of tutorials that guide you through the implementation of neural networks using shaders in the following link:
