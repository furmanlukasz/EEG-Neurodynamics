### What's next

With this foundation, you hopefully have a good notion of what Machine Learning is and how it works. 

**TDNeuron** focuses in as subset of Machine Learning called "**Deep Learning**", where we utilize networks that consist of various different layers to solve a myriad of problems, as we have seen so far in our simple examples.

Your next step should be to dive into TDNeuron and use the acquired knowledge to train your first neural network. We have used here the naming conventions employed across our implementation, so when you transit to work with TDNeuron its components should be fairly clear. 

Please see "Getting started" for a step-by-step introduction to the system and how to training process works. 

TDNeuron supports **convolutional neural networks** as well. Please refer to "Appendix 04: Convolution" for a visualization of a convolutional layer.

There is a whole world to explore within Machine Learning and he have only but scratched the surface here. You can consult the following resources for knowledge and inspiration:
