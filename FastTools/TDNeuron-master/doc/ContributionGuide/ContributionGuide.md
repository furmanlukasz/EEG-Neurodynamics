## Contribution

TDNeuron is an open-source effort created with the idea that it will be grown and enhanced by the community. We could not be happier to get user contributions. Here some possible scenarios:

### Developer

If you wish to contribute to TDNeuron as a developer, please refer to the "Developers guide" first to get familiar with our conventions. Proceed by creating a ticket in the issue tracker:

https://github.com/tdneuron/TDNeuron/issues

Once the ticket is there, please assign yourself to the ticket and clearly mark with a label what it is in nature, e.g. "enhancement", "feature request", etc.

This allows us to keep track on what the community is working on, and to pay attention to progress by assigning tickets to milestones that will be unrolled periodically. Please do not assign a milestone yourself, we will take care of that.

You may work on your module independently and, when ready, you can create a pull request from the Github repository. We can then proceed to evaluate your contribution and merge it with the master branch.

### Documentator

If you wish to contribute as a documentator, do not hesitate to jump in the task. Like above, create a ticket for the place you think can be improved, expanded or where you think documentation is missing, and assign yourself with a 'documentation' label. 

### Models/Modules

You may also wish to contribute with a model you have created, or a module of input data you have prepared. In this case, please refer to the "Developers guide" to get familiar with our conventions first, then create a ticket in the issue tracker with the label "asset", assign yourself to the issue and provide a succint description of the model or module that you wish to contribute.

### Others

If there is any other type of contribution you would like to make, create an issue in the issue tracker with the label "contribution proposal". We would be happy to read from you.
